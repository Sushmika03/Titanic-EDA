# Titanic-EDA
# Task overview 
This repository contains a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the classic Titanic passenger dataset. We investigate which factors most influenced survival, using both statistical summaries and rich visualizations.
# files 
- `train.csv`: Titanic training data (with survival labels)
- `test.csv`: Titanic test data (without survival labels)
- `gender_submission.csv`: Sample submission file
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with the full analysis
- `Titanic_EDA.pdf`: PDF export of the notebook (code + visual outputs)
# findings 
- **Gender**: Women had a higher survival rate.
- **Class**: First-class passengers had a higher survival probability.
- **Fare**: Higher ticket fare was associated with a higher survival rate.
